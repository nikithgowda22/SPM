            a: ["d"],
            type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: d.</strong> Option d is not a symptom, but rather a cause or characteristic of modern software systems. The increasing complexity of tasks software is expected to perform has contributed to the software crisis, but it is not itself a symptom."
        },
        {
            q: "2. Which one of the following is a possible reason for the effort, time, and cost required to develop a program to increase exponentially with the size of the program while using the build and fix style of development?",
            options: {
                a: "Programming languages lack suitable constructs required for the build and fix style of development.",
                b: "Programmers lack competence in effectively using the build and fix style.",
                c: "Programmers are able to use abstraction and decomposition techniques in a very limited way while using the build and fix model.",
                d: "Programmers are able to make limited use of GO TO statements while using the build and fix model."
            },
            a: ["c"],
            type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: c.</strong> The build and fix model is an unstructured and ad hoc approach to software development, where the software is developed without any proper specification, design, or planning. This lack of structure prevents effective use of abstraction and decomposition, leading to chaotic complexity as the project size grows."
        },
        {
            q: "3. A software development company is likely to face which one of the following difficulties, if it adopts the waterfall model in preference to the exploratory (build and fix) program development style in its development projects?",
            options: {
                a: "Increased development cost",
                b: "Increased development time",
                c: "Decreased program maintainability",
                d: "Increased documentation overhead"
            },
            a: ["d"],
            type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: d.</strong> The waterfall model is a plan-driven, sequential process that emphasizes thorough documentation at each stage before moving to the next. This contrasts sharply with the ad-hoc 'build and fix' style, making the increase in documentation a significant change."

            },
a: ["d"],
            type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: d.</strong> Software service projects involve providing a service to a specific client (e.g., maintenance, customization). Software product development is about creating a generic product for a broader market, not a service for a single client."
        },
        {
            q: "5. Model building can be considered to be an application of which one of the following techniques?",

            type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: a.</strong> Model building involves creating a simplified representation of a complex system by focusing only on relevant aspects while omitting unnecessary details. This is the essence of abstraction."
        },
        {
            q: "6. Suppose you are getting an application software developed by a vendor for your organization. Which one of the following characteristics of the software delivered by the vendor to your organization is not a symptom of the present software crisis?",
            options: {
                a: "Fails to meet user requirements.",
                b: "Expensive.",

            a: ["c"],
            type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: c.</strong> Being highly interactive is a positive attribute of modern software, not a symptom of a crisis. It typically improves user experience and is a desired feature. The other options are classic symptoms of poor software development."

        {
            q: "7. A software process model represents which one of the following?",

                a: "The way in which software is developed",
                b: "The way in which software processes data",

            q: "8. Which one of the following is not an important difference between the software development projects being undertaken now and the ones that were being undertaken several decades back?",

                a: "Project durations have shrunk from multi-years to few months now",
                b: "Project sizes have increased manifolds",
                c: "Use of high-level languages",
                d: "Increased code and design reuse"
            },
            a: ["c"],
            type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: c.</strong> High-level languages like FORTRAN and COBOL were already in use several decades ago. While modern languages are more advanced, the fundamental shift to high-level languages from machine/assembly language happened long ago and is not a key differentiator of *current* projects versus those from a few decades back."

            q: "10. Which one of the following is the most acceptable definition of a project?",
            options: {
                a: "A series of activities designed to accomplish some objective",
                b: "An attempt to perform something that has well-defined objectives, and requires both human and other types of resources and usually has to abide by several constraints",

A large road project is also massive and requires a huge workforce. The key differentiators making software harder to manage are its intangibility, the high flexibility (and volatility) of requirements, and the complexity of the intellectual work involved."

The results of the feasibility study (is it technically possible? financially viable?) provide essential data for the cost-benefit analysis within the business case. The two are closely linked, and feasibility often precedes or is part of the business case development."

            a: ["d"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: d.</strong> A cost schedule, also known as a cost baseline or S-curve, plots the planned cumulative project costs against time. It shows how much money is planned to be spent by any given point in the project, providing a baseline against which actual spending can be tracked."

            a: ["c"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: c.</strong> Syntax errors are errors that violate the grammatical rules of a programming language. These are almost always caught automatically by the compiler or interpreter before any human review takes place. Code reviews focus on higher-level issues like logic, algorithm efficiency, and adherence to standards, which automated tools cannot easily detect."

            a: ["c", "e"], type: "msq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: c, e.</strong> (c) is true because a key goal of formal code inspection is to ensure compliance with coding standards. (e) is true because the primary purpose of a review (like a walkthrough or inspection) is to find defects efficiently. Discussing solutions during the meeting is inefficient and should be done offline by the author."

Both can shorten the critical path. Splitting an activity (e.g., into two smaller, sequential activities) generally does not shorten the total duration and may even increase it due to hand-off overhead.
